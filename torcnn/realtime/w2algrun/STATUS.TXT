w2alg status output:

When you do a 'w2alg status' you get a list of identifiers and
either 'not running' or a list of three processes.
Something like the following:

Identifier (group-name-process) => Processes (See STATUS.TXT)
---------------------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL-RSSD-A ==> (not running)
KTLX-CLOCK1-A ==>  w2run(338)   xclock(1643)   w2logger(1644)
KTLX-CLOCK2-A ==>  w2run(909)   oclock(1666)   w2logger(1667)
TEST-XTERM1-A ==> (not running)
TEST2-XTERM1-A ==> (not running)
***COMPLETED STATUS


w2run(338) means the process watcher has process id 338.  This
is the process that keeps an eye on the 'real' process

w2logger(1644) means the logger responsible for that process has
id 1644. This is the process that autologs the output of the
'real' process.

Your 'real' process should show up as something like xclock(1643)
for instance.  Also, with processes like RSSD that spawn children
themselves, you may have multiple rssd(ids) listed.

if you DONT see your 'real' process, but just the w2run(id), then
most likely your process is dying as soon as it is started.
